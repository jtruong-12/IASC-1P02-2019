<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Hi everyone! My name is <em>Jenny</em>. I have created this little page to tell you a little bit about <strong>myself</strong>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I am currently a student at <strong>Brock University</strong>, and I am finishing my degree in <em>Medical Sciences</em> with a minor in <em>Sociology</em>. One of my favourite subjects in high school was always <strong><em>science</em></strong> (as well as math!), so even in post-secondary, I took a lot of <strong>science electives</strong>.</p>

<p><em>I suggest taking a look at Brock's website to see the different programs that they have to offer.</em></p>
